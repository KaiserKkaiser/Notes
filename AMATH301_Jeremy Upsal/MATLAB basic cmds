%% MATLAB basics

clear all; close all; clc; %% do this before beginning a new .mat file or section of code
	- click "Run" in Editor window to test code
	- use semicolons to suppress variables 
	- diary September30.diary (diary NAME) %% records your inputs to the command window
		○ diary off %% closes your diary 
    
load('yourMATFILE.mat') %% loads data from a .mat file containing variables
a = load('s.dat') %% loads an individual dat file
%% .m files store MATLAB code in the form of scripts (instructions)
    
Matrices and Plotting
		○ 3*A = multiply everything in A by 3
		○ A = A.*[1;2]; multiply A by vector B (1,2) aka multiply only second row by 2
		○ x= A(1:2), get the first column, two rows.
		○ Magic square
		    magic(N) is an N-by-N matrix constructed from the integers
		    1 through N^2 with equal row, column, and diagonal sums.
		    Produces valid magic squares for all N > 0 except N = 2.
		○ B = A(2,3:4), B is A's 2nd row 3rd and 4th column
		○ size(A) = 4 4 
			§ 4 rows
			§ 4 columns
		○ dot prime (.') %% complex numbers or matrix element-wise operations
		○ y = y.' %% flip y from row vector to column vector and vice versa
    ○ x = -10:0.1:10; y = exp(x)-tan(x); plot(x,y) %% plots x and y points on a single graph
      %% exp() is e^(something)
    ○ hold on %% this keeps your current graph if you continue to execute another plot function
    ○ plot(x,y,'ko') %% plot with black circles, see 'help plot' for more colors
    
single quotation = string 'c'
x = linspace(-2,2,10)
		○ 10 evenly spaced points on a line, respect to x-axis
		○ start with -2, ends with 2

pause(1) %% pause time for 1 second

%% Note: MATLAB starts indexing from 1, not 0 :(
% ex: if array has 1 thing, the 1st thing is index 1
if statement syntax:
  if LOGICAL
    %% your whatever code
  else if LOGICAL
    %% ..........
  else
    % blah
  end
for statement syntax:
  for LOGICAL % example: for k = 1:80, for k = 1, k = 2..... k = 80
    %% code
  end

How to Make a Good Graph
  labels (x and y)
			§ xlabel('x') %% create a label named 'x' for the x-axis
			§ ylabel('y')
	titles
			§ title('my graph', 'Fontsize', 15)
				□ font size 15
				□ How to make everything font size 15?
					® set(gca,'Fontsize',15)

	Legend
			§ legend('data 1', 'data 2', 'data 3')
				□ have a legend corresponding to each data set
				□ How to put legend in the best location???
					® legend('data 1', 'data 2', 'data 3', 'Location', 'Best')
					® can manually move the legend with your mouse
					® legend(….. 'Location', ___)
						◊ 'NorthEast'
							} the default corner if nothing specified
						◊ 'North'
						◊ etc
						◊ 'EastOutside' 
							} outside the graph box and east of it
				
	Sub-Plots
	  subplot(2,1,1)
			§ 2 row 1 column will be your 1st figure (1st thing you 'plotted')
    subplot(3,1,2)
			§ 3 rows 1 column 2nd figure
	    %% Can work with multiple Subplots!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  grid on
		○ helpful for visualization
		○ shows grid when plotting
	axis off 
		○ takes off all the background lines from graph
	show greek characters?
		○ use backslash
		○ xlabel('x \psi')
  text within the graph
		○ text(1,5, 'HALLO') % where do I want the text? (x,y) location
    
  A = '5555555';
  title(['my graph A=' num2str(A)], 'Fontsize', 15) %% converts a number variable to a String
