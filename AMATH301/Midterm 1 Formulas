length(x)returns the length (i.e.  number of elements) of the vector x.

size(A) returns a row vector whose elements contain the dimensions of A.

linspace(a,b,n) generates a row vector of n linearly spaced points between a and b.

function_name = @(variable_names) formula creates an anonymous function.
	- variable_names should be a comma separated list.
	
norm(x) returns the norm of the vector x
	- norm(x,Inf)returns the infinity norm.
		â—‹ is equivalent to max(abs(x)).

det(A) and cond(A) return the determinant and condition number of the matrix A.

x = fzero(fun,x0) finds a root (or zero) of the function fun near the point x0.

diag(A) returns a column vector of the diagonal elements of the matrix A 
	- or creates a square matrix with the vector A on the diagonal.

triu(A) and tril(A) 
	- returns the upper and lower triangular parts of A, respectively.

[L,U,P]= lu(A) returns  an  upper  triangular  matrix  in U,  lower  triangular  matrix L with  unit  diagonal  and permutation matrix P such that LU=P*A.

[V,D] = eig(A)returns a matrix V whose columns are eigenvectors of A
	- D diagonal matrix, entries are the corresponding eigenvalues of A.

[x,fval]= fminbnd(fun,x1,x2)
	- returns a value x that is a local minimizer of the scalar valued function described in fun in the intervalx1 < x < x2.  
	- It also returns fval which is the value of the function fun at the point x

[x,fval]= fminsearch(fun,x0)
	- starts at the point x0and returns a value x that is a local minimizer of the function described in fun.  
	- It also returns fval which is the value of the function fun at x.
