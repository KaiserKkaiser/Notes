**( 930, #31) Let f be a scalar field and F a vector field. State whether each expression is a scalar field, a vector field, or meaningless.**

_Correspond to STEWART Calculus 7E Exercises 16.5 12_

**Solution:**

**(a) curl f - meaningless; a curl can only be taken of a vector field**

**(b) grad f - vector field; a gradient results in a vector field**

**(c) div F - scalar field; a divergence results in a scalar field**

**(d) curl( grad f ) - vector field; the curl of a vector field results in a vector field**

**(e) grad F - meaningless; a gradient can only be taken of a scalar field**

**(f) grad( div F ) - vector field; the gradient of a scalar field is a vector field**

**(g) div( grad f ) - scalar field; the divergence of a vector field is a scalar field**

**(h) grad ( div f ) - meaningless; the divergence of a scalar field can not be taken**

**(i) curl ( curl F ) - vector field; the curl of a vector field is a vector field**

**(j) div( div F ) - meaningless; the divergence of a scalar field can not be taken**

**(k) ( grad f ) x ( div F ) - meaningless; a vector and scalar field cannon be crossed**

**(l) div( curl( grad f )) - scalar field; the divergence of a vector field is a scalar field**
