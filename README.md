I did not get 4.0 for every course, so sometimes my notes may be unreliable. Even I got a 4.0 for a course, it also doesn't mean I master it. Therefore, please do not totally depend on my notes: generating your own notes might be helpful for learning. I hope they can just work as references for you.
Wish you have a great experience of learning, and wish you have a satisfactory GPA.
