We did not get 4.0 for every course, so sometimes our notes may be unreliable. Even we got a 4.0 for a course, it also doesn't mean we have mastered it. Therefore, please do not totally depend on our notes: making your own notes might be helpful for learning. All of us hope they can just work as references for you.
</p>
<p>
Wish you have a great experience of learning, and wish you have a satisfactory GPA.
